# Power Supply PCB Project

This project involves the development of a power supply PCB that takes a 12V input and distributes 5V and 3.3V outputs, supporting up to 5A of current. The PCB features voltage regulators, a switching circuit with a MOSFET, energy monitoring, and motor overload protection.

## Key Components

- **LM805 (5V Regulator):** Provides a regulated 5V output from the 12V input.
- **LM1117 (3.3V Regulator):** Provides a regulated 3.3V output, powered by the 5V output from the LM805 in a **cascaded configuration**.
- **Electrolytic Capacitors (100uF):** Placed at the input of the regulators to filter low-frequency noise generated by motors in the system.
- **Ceramic Capacitors (100nF):** Placed at the output of the regulators to filter low-frequency noise caused by the switching circuit.
- **Electrolytic Capacitor (10uF):** Connected in parallel with the 12V power source to filter high- and low-frequency noise, ensuring a stable power supply.
- **MOSFET IRF9540N (P-Channel):** Used to control system power switching.
- **INA219 (Power Monitor):** A current/voltage sensor to monitor the system's energy consumption.
- **5A Fuse:** Protects the motors from overcurrent.
- **Diode (in parallel with the motors):** Protects the system from voltage spikes generated by the motors during shutdown.

## Functionality

This PCB receives a 12V input and distributes two regulated output voltages: 5V and 3.3V. Key functionalities include:

### 1. Voltage Regulation

- The LM805 regulates the 12V input to provide a 5V output.
- The LM1117 regulates the 5V output from the LM805 to provide a 3.3V output in a **cascaded configuration**.

### 2. Noise Filtering

- Electrolytic capacitors (100uF) filter low-frequency noise at the input of the regulators.
- Ceramic capacitors (100nF) filter noise at the output of the regulators caused by switching circuits.
- An electrolytic capacitor (10uF) connected in parallel with the 12V power source filters high- and low-frequency noise, providing a cleaner power supply.

### 3. Switching Circuit

- A P-Channel MOSFET (IRF9540N) is used to control system power.
- Two switches are included for power control:
  - **Emergency Stop Switch:** Connected to the gate of the MOSFET, this switch cuts power to the entire system when pressed.
  - **Power-On Switch:** Connected to the source of the MOSFET, this switch activates the system when pressed.

### 4. Energy Monitoring

- The INA219 sensor monitors the system's energy consumption, measuring both current and voltage.

### 5. Motor Overload Protection

- A 5A fuse in series with the motors prevents overcurrent damage.
- A diode in parallel with the motors protects against voltage spikes generated when the motors are powered off.

3. **Switching Circuit:**
   - Connect the MOSFET as per the schematic, with the emergency stop switch wired to the gate and the power-on switch wired to the source.

4. **Energy Monitoring:**
   - Connect the INA219 sensor to measure current and voltage across the system.

5. **Motor Protection:**
   - Install the 5A fuse in series with the motors and the protection diode in parallel with the motors.

## Final Considerations

This project provides a robust solution for distributing 5V and 3.3V regulated outputs from a 12V input, featuring noise filtering, energy monitoring, and motor protection. The cascaded regulator configuration ensures efficient voltage regulation for sensitive components, while the additional 10uF capacitor improves noise filtering, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply. The system is ideal for applications involving motors and other components requiring a secure and clean power distribution.
